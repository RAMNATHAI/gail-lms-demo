## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from create-react-app

## Customization

### Renaming and Adapting to Your Needs

This boilerplate uses healthcare-specific terminology (patients, doctors, appointments, etc.), but you can easily rename these components to match your specific domain:

1. Rename the folders in `src/pages/` to match your domain entities
2. Update the routes in `App.tsx`
3. Modify the menu items in `MainLayout.tsx`
4. Update the API service methods in `services/api.ts`

### Theming

You can customize the theme by editing the `src/styles/theme.ts` file. The application uses Material UI's theming system.

### API Integration

The application is set up to work with a RESTful API. Update the API base URL in `src/services/api.ts` to point to your backend.

## Authentication

The boilerplate includes a complete authentication system with:

- Login
- Registration
- Forgot password
- Protected routes

For demonstration purposes, the authentication is simulated with localStorage. In a production environment, you should replace this with actual API calls to your backend.
